            <p>
                Between the three games with all their DLC's there is well over 100+ hours of gameplay to enjoy inside the trilogy. This isn't including the vast universe and extra content such as books and
                Mass Effect themed mods for countless other games. There is so much more to experience once you have finished playing the games for the first time.
